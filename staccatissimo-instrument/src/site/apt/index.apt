About Staccatissimo-Instrument
 
 Staccatissimo-Instrument is the annotation-oriented instrumentation tool of the {{{http://staccatocommons.sourceforge.net}Staccatissimo project}}, built on top of {{{http://www.javassist.org}Javassist}}. It allows compile-time annotation processing and class instrumentation in an event-handling fashion.       
 

Getting started

* Introduction
 
  Staccatissimo-Instrument is a tool for processing annotations with instrumentation capabilities.
 It consist of an instrumenter that runs on compiled classes directory with a extremly simple lifecycle:
   
    [[1]] Scans the directory for classfiles and loads each one it finds
    
    [[2]] Scans each loaded class for annotations, and depending on the annotated element and annotation type, 
 invokes one or more custom handlers provided by the client
    
    [[3]] Handlers are custom classes that implement one or more interfaces 
 from <<<package net.sf.staccatocommons.instrument.handler>>>, which have the chance of inspecting and/or 
 modifying the annotated code or the processing context. Handlers 
 have full access to {{{http://http://www.csg.is.titech.ac.jp/~chiba/javassist/tutorial/tutorial.html}Javassist}} API.
     
    [[4]] Finally, the instrumenter makes changes persistent by replacing old classfiles with modified ones.
    
* Running it
  
  The instrumenter must be run programatically, so you will need a main-like class to do experiment with it. Doing that is quite simple, just need to invoke  <<<net.sf.staccatocommons.instrument.InstrumentationRunner.runInstrumentation(InstrumenterConfigurer, Directory, String)>>>. For example:
    
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   InstrumentationRunner.runInstrumentation(new InstrumenterConfigurer() {
       public void configureInstrumenter(InstrumenterConfiguration instrumenter) {
           instrumenter 
               .addAnnotationHanlder(handler1)
               .addAnnotationHanlder(handler2)
               .setInstrumentationMark(mark);
       }
   }, new Directory("target/classes"), "");
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    
 As you can see, the instrumenter itself is completely hidden, but you can register annotation handlers and an "instrumentation mark" using an <<<InstrumenterConfigurer>>>. In this example you can already see most of the elements of the Staccatissimo-instrument API: handlers, instrumentation marks and configurers.
 
* The API

** InstrumenterConfigurer 

 As seen before, the configurer is just a callback for registering custom components into the instrumenter,
 exposed as an <<<InstrumenterConfiguration>>> argument. 

** AnnotationHandler

 Handlers contain the concrete logic of annotation processing. There are 
four specific handler interfaces, one for each supported annotation 
element: <<<ArgumentAnnotationHandler>>>, <<<ClassAnnotationHandler>>>, <<<ConstructorAnnotationHandler>>> and 
<<<MethodAnnotationHandler>>>. In addition to specific methods defined by each interface - see each interface javadoc for 
more details - all handlers need to override the method <<<Class<? extends Annotation>  AnnotationHandler.getSupportedAnnotationType()>>>, 
which allows the instrumenter to relate the proper handler o handlers with each annotation - there is no problem in registering more 
than one handler for the same. 

** AnnotationContext

 AnnotationHandler's methods for performing concrete processing take two arguments: the annotation to process and a context, which represents
the surrounding the annotation discovered by the instrumenter, which gives access to Javassits API. There are four specific AnnotationContexts
which correspond to each AnnotationHandler: <<<MethodAnnotationContext>>>, <<<ConstructorAnnotationContext>>>, <<<ArgumentAnnotationContext>>> 
and <<<ClassAnnotationContext>>>.    
 
* A complete example

 <The complete code can be found {{{https:/staccatocommons.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/staccatocommons/staccatissimo/trunk/commons-instrument-examples}here}}>
 
 Lets suppose that you have an Account, whose balance can be augmented by
depositing money, or reseted to zero. Both operations must be logged. Also, 
when depositing, some preconditions must be checked: the amount to deposit must be not null and >= 0. A n√§ive implementation 
will look like:
    
+---------------------------------+
public class Account {

    private static final Logger logger = ...;

    ...
        
    public void deposit(BigDecimal amount) {
        if (amount == null) {
            String message = "amount must not be null";
            logger.severe(message);
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(message);
        }
        if (amount.compareTo(BigDecimal.ZERO) < 0) {
            String message = "amount must be positive";
            logger.severe(message);
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(message);
        }
        balance = balance.add(amount);
        logger.warning("deposit");
    }

    public void resetBalance() {
        balance = BigDecimal.ZERO;
        logger.warning("resetBalance");
    }
    
    ...
}
+----------------------------------+
    
  The previous code has several flaws. That which is of particular interest here is that the logic of "whenever methods like  
resetBalance and deposit are evaluated, log the invocation" and "when a non negative constraint is violated, throw an exception" 
are harcoded and not encapsulated properly. 
 
  Using Staccatissimo-instrument we can create some annotations that encapsulate that behavior, and document it, by free. 
So lets define two annotations: <<<Loggeable>>>, and <<<NonNegativeDecimal>>>:

+---------------------------------+

@Documented
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
public @interface Loggeable {}

@Documented
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.CLASS)
@Target(ElementType.PARAMETER)
public @interface NonNegativeDecimal { String value(); }

+---------------------------------+    

 The second step is to define the annotation processors. A very simple implementation would look like the following:
 
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
public class LogHandler implements MethodAnnotationHandler<Loggeable> {

    public Class<Loggeable> getSupportedAnnotationType() {
        return Loggeable.class;
    }

    public void preProcessAnnotatedMethod(Loggeable annotation, MethodAnnotationContext context)
        throws CannotCompileException {
        if (!hasLogger(context)) {
            CtClass declaringClass = context.getMethod().getDeclaringClass();
            CtField field = CtField.make(
                "private static final java.util.logging.Logger logger = java.util.logging.Logger.getLogger(\""
                    + declaringClass.getName() + "\");",
                declaringClass);
            declaringClass.addField(field);
        }
    }

    public void postProcessAnnotatedMethod(Loggeable annotation, MethodAnnotationContext context)
        throws CannotCompileException {
        context.getMethod().insertAfter("logger.warning(\"" + context.getMethod().getName() + "\");");
        context.getMethod().addCatch("logger.severe($e.getMessage());throw $e;", getThrowable(context));
    }

   ....
}   
+--------------------------------------------------------------+
 
 Finally, we need to annotate the methods and arguments with the new annotations: 
 
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ 
 public class Account2 {

    ....

    @Loggeable
    public void deposit(@NonNull @NonNegativeDecimal("amount") BigDecimal amount) {
        balance = balance.add(amount);
    }

    @Loggeable
    public void resetBalance() {
        balance = BigDecimal.ZERO;
    }
    
    ...
 }
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

 Now it is easy to see that the resulting code is much more clean and simple than the original. 
 
 In order to run the instrumenter and test the Account2 code, use the following junit4 snippet:
 
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    @org.junit.BeforeClass
    public static void before() throws Exception {
        InstrumentationRunner.runInstrumentation(new InstrumenterConfigurer() {
            public void configureInstrumenter(InstrumenterConfiguration instrumenter) {
                instrumenter //
                    .addAnnotationHanlder(new LogHandler())
                    .addAnnotationHanlder(new NonNegativeDecimalHandler())
                    .setInstrumentationMark(new SimpleInstrumentationMark("log-example", "instrumented-1.0"));
            }
        },
            new Directory("target/classes"),
            "");
    }

    @org.junit.Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
    public void testNegativeAmmount() throws Exception {
        Account2 account2 = new Account2(BigDecimal.valueOf(10));
        account2.resetBalance();
        account2.deposit(BigDecimal.valueOf(-10));
    }
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ 

 The test should pass, as in the third line a negative decimal is passed. Also, you should gete a log output similar to the following:
 
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ 
02/01/2011 23:09:10 net.sf.staccatocommons.instrument.examples.Account2 resetBalance
WARNING: resetBalance
02/01/2011 23:09:10 net.sf.staccatocommons.instrument.examples.Account2 deposit
SEVERE: amount must be positive
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+    
 
 Perhaps the reader has already notice that the idea behind this example is the separation of crosscutting concerns, 
and is probably saying: "That is not new! It is nothing I couldn't have achieved using AOP!". And 
that is true, the final result is quite similar. However, Staccatissimo-instrument is by no means a replacement
of your favorite Aspects framework or language extension, because:
 
    * It is not a language extension and adds no new abstractions or vocabulary. It is simply a non-invasive annotation processor.  
 
    * It is a low-level API: you directly handle the instrumentation. It is really flexible, as 
programmer has access this way to all the power of Javassist, but needs to handle its complexity. 
 
    * It is not pointcut-based, but annotations based. The main consequence is that crosscuting behavior can be easily encapsulated, but 
there is not inversion in the direction of injection.   
 
    * It is a compile-time tool, as opposite of many AOP frameworks, that inject advice on runtime.  The main benefit is that it adds no 
significant runtime overhead

 
What is next?
   
   * Explore the {{{http://staccatocommons.sourceforge.net/commons-instrument/apidocs/index.html}API javadoc}} 
   
   * Write custom annotation processors and build your own instrumenter using them
   
   * Staccatissimo project offers a ready to use instrumenter for simple precondition and postcondition annotations - in a way similar 
to the NonNegativeDecimal proof-of-concept of the previous example - based on Staccatissimo-Check API. It is extensively used on 
all the Staccatissimo projects. It can be found {{{http://staccatocommons.sourceforge.net/commons-restrictions-instrument/}here}}. 
Also a easy-to-use maven plugin exists for it, it can be found {{{http://staccatocommons.sourceforge.net/commons-restrictions-instrument-maven-plugin}here}}.
