/**
 * Interface for annotation handlers that can process annotations in methods.
 * <p>
 * This interface exposes both a
 * {@link #preProcessAnnotatedMethod(Annotation, MethodAnnotationContext)} and
 * {@link #postProcessAnnotatedMethod(Annotation, MethodAnnotationContext)}, in
 * order to let clients perform any instrumentation or context update whenever
 * they need - after, before or around processing argument annotations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Although in most scenarios implementing the handling logic in either on
 * preprocesing or postprocessing is the same, there are specific cases where
 * the distinction is important. Typical case is when a
 * {@link MethodAnnotationHandler} instruments a method by surrounding it with
 * some kind of block - a try-catch, for instance: if that instrumentation is
 * performing during preprocessing, and then, an
 * {@link ArgumentAnnotationHandler} that discovers an annotation on the same
 * method inserts some portion of code, that code may be placed after or before
 * the block. However, if performed on postprocessing, such portion of code will
 * be always surrounded by the block.
 * </p>
