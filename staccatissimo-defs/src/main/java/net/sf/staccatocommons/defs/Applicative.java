/**
 * {@link Applicable} is an annotation for abstract types that have
 * code-block/command/strategy/closure/lambda semantics, with an only abstract
 * method that implements such code, called applicative method.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In order to remain as general purposes as possible, such types does not
 * impose any {@link Restriction} over the type itself nor its applicative
 * method. There are however some recommendations for implementing it, that will
 * maximize the reusability of concrete classes.
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Implementors <strong>should</strong> be {@link Transparent}, or at least
 * {@link SideEffectFree}. An obvious case where this is not generally possible
 * is for {@link Applicable} that return {@link Void}, which will be applied for
 * its side effects only</li>
 * <li>Implementors <strong>should</strong> be {@link Immutable}, regardless
 * they are {@link SideEffectFree} or not</li>
 * <li>Public available implementors<strong>should</strong> be
 * {@link Serializable}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Methods that return {@link Applicative}s <strong>must</strong> be
 * {@link NonNull} and {@link Transparent}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In addition, methods that return {@link Applicative}s and are annotated with
 * restrictions, alter {@link Restriction} semantic in some way: they do not
 * indicate that the method is restricted, but that the applicative's method is
 * restricted. For example, in the following code:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#064;Transparent
 * Thunk&lt;Integer&gt; foo();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The {@link Transparent} annotations does not indicate that method foo() is
 * transparent, but that the applicative method of the returned Thunks, that is,
 * Thunk.value(), is transparent.

 * @deprecated user {@link FunctionLikeObject} instead
