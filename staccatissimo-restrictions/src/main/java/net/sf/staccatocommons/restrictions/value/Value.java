/**
 * 
 * {@link Value} annotation describes objects whose identity is not important,
 * but that are completely described by its state instead, like {@link String}s,
 * {@link Number}s and {@link Date}s.
 * <p>
 * More formally, classes marked as {@link Value} must grant that it is possible
 * to have two instances such that <code>a != b && a.equals(b)</code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Classes annotated this way grant that all their instances observe the
 * following {@link Value} protocol
 * <ul>
 * <li>Implement equality so that it is not based in identity, but in its
 * internal state instead. Values must override {@link #equals(Object)}</li>
 * <li>Implement hashCode to be consistent with equals, in order to be compliant
 * with general {@link Object#hashCode()} contract</li>
 * <li>{@link Value}s implement {@link Object#toString()} in order to provide a
 * descriptive representation of the object state</li>
 * <li>Are {@link Serializable}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Although {@link Value} objects are usually immutable, this annotation does
 * not make any assumption about it, as it only imposes restrictions regarding
 * identity. Mutability aspect is covered by other annotations, like
 * {@link Immutable}, {@link Unmodifiable} and the rest of the annotations
 * defined in this package
