/**
 * {@link Immutable}s are objects whose state, if any, can not be mutated in any

 * immutable objects are strings and {@code Collections.emptyList()}.
 * <p>
 * * Classes annotated as {@link Immutable} indicate that all their instances
 * have such property. Methods annotated as {@link Immutable} denote that all
