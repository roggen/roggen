/**
 * Side effect free is a {@link Restriction} that applies to methods that have
 * no side effects. As a consequence, such methods <strong>must not</strong>
 * modify the state of its arguments, if any, nor the <code>this</code>
 * reference, if non-static, nor any attribute in scope.
 * <p>
 * When applied to types, it means that all its methods are
 * {@link SideEffectFree}. As a consequence, statefull classes that are
 * annotated this way <strong>must</strong> be ummodifiable, as mutators are
 * inheritely non-side-effect free. Thus there is no reason no annotate
 * {@link SideEffectFree} classes as {@link Unmodifiable}, as it is implicit.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Being {@link SideEffectFree} is necessary but not sufficient for being
 * referential transparent, thus methods annotated this way <strong>may</strong>
 * return different results for the same arguments, if any. Such methods should
 * be annotated with {@link Transparent} instead.
 * </p>
