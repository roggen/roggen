/**
 * Unmodifiables are objects that do not expose publicly any method that may
 * modify receiver internal state, if any. However, object's state can still be
 * mutated indirectly, if it holds and/or exposes references to objects that may
 * be mutated
 * <p>
 * Unmodifiables can still implement lazy initialization and/or caching, as long
 * as it remains encapsulated and is not exposed publicly
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Types annotated as {@link Unmodifiable} denote that all their instances grant
 * to have such property. Methods annotated as {@link Unmodifiable} denote that
