/**
 * Transparent is a {@link Restriction} that applies to methods that are
 * referentially transparent - their invocations can be replaced by its return
 * value. In other words, are {@link SideEffectFree} and return always equal
 * results for equals arguments.
 * <p>
 * When applied to types, it means that all its methods are {@link Transparent}.
 * As a consequence, statefull classes that are annotated this way
 * <strong>must</strong> be immutable, as otherwise, changes of state would
 * eventually impact on changes in results. Thus there is no reason no annotate
 * {@link Transparent} classes as {@link Immutable}, as it is implicit.
 * </p>
 * Being {@link SideEffectFree} necessary for being {@link Transparent}, there
 * is no reason no annotate {@link Transparent} classes or methods as
 * {@link SideEffectFree}, as it is implicit.
 * 
 * As a consequence of being {@link Immutable}, {@link Transparent} classes are
 * thread safe.
