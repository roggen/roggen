/**
 * An utility class for accessing in a shared, thread safe {@link LambdaFactory}
 * , or creating standalone {@link LambdaFactory}s
 * 
 * {@link Lambda} and {@link LambdaFactory} a DSL for instantiating simple
 * {@link Function}s and {@link Predicate}s. There are two manners of using
 * those classes:
 * 
 * <h3>Using shared factories</h3>
 * 
 * This is the simplest use case. Just it needs to static-import {@link Lambda},
 * and combine {@link #$(Class)} with {@link #lambda(Object)} and variants, in
 * the form <code>lambdaVariant($(ArgumentType).message(args...))</code> . For
 * example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * lambda($(Collection.class).isEmpty());
 * </pre>
 * 
 * This creates a new {@link Predicate} that takes a {@link Collection} argument
 * and answers if it is empty. It is equivalent to the more verbose:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * new Predicate&lt;Collection&gt;() {
 *   public boolean eval(Collection arg) {
 *     return arg.isEmpty();
 *   }
 * };
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Although this syntax is quite convenient, accessing the shared
 * {@link LambdaFactory} - hidden by the static-imports - needs a thread local
 * variable to make it thread safe, which may be seen in some contexts like
 * resources waste.
 * 
 * <h3>Using Local factories</h3>
 * 
 * For applications that want to avoid the previously described synchronization,
 * then a better idea is to use local factories instead of a shared one, which
 * looks a little less fancy, though. Local factories works exactly in the same
 * was as shared factories, but need an explicit factory instantiation and
 * reference. For example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * LambdaFactory l = Lambda.factory();
 * l.lambda(l.$(Collection.class).isEmpty());
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Local factories <strong>must</strong> be declared as local variables.
