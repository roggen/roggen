/**
 * A {@link SerializationManager} is an object capable of both converting an
 * object into an {@link OutputStream} and recovering it from an
 * {@link InputStream}
 * <p>
 * This interface does not make any assumption regarding the strategy and format
 * in which the object is serialized, it may be in plain text, like JSON, or in
 * some kind of binary format. That should be specified by subinterfaces and/or
 * implementors.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The only constraint a {@link SerializationManager} must meet regarding the
 * stream format is that {@link #serialize(Object, OutputStream)} and
 * {@link #deserialize(InputStream)} methods must be compatible, that means that
 * it must grant that if an input object is serialized and then deserialized
 * using the same instance of this manager, the output object must have the same
 * relevant estate that the original one. For every objects that follow
 * {@link Value} contract - either they implement that interface or not - the
 * following invariant must be satisfied by any implementor:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Value valueObject = (...);
 * SerializationManager sm = (...);
 * ByteArrayOutputStream out = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
 * sm.serialize(valueObject, out);
 * ByteArrayInputStream in = new ByteArrayInputStream(out.toByteArray());
 * assert(valueObject.equals(sm.deserialize(in)));
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@link SerializationManager} are not required to be able to serialize and
 * deserialize every possible object, and implementors may impose additional
 * restrictions to the kind of objects that are serilizable.
 * </p>
