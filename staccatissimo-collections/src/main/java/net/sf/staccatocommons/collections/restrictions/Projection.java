/**
 * {@link Projection} restriction signals that the annotated method will not
 * impact the operation on the receptor object, but instead return a new object
 * that represents the result of just operation.
 * 
 * Projection methods <strong>should</strong> return objects that share the same
 * interface of the receptor objection.
 * 
 * Projections <strong>may</strong> be lazy or eager- that is, perform the
 * actual operation on demand or not.
 * 
 * {@link Projection} methods <strong>must</strong> be non null, so there is no
 * need to annotate them as {@link NonNull}, as it is implied.
