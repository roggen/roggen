What is Staccatissimo?
 
  Staccatissimo is the core library of the {{{http://staccatocommons.sourceforge.net/}StaccatoCommons}} project. It contains generic code that solves small but very frequent problems that arise when developing software using the Java language, like:

 * a too thin-interfaced collection framework, with many useful collection implementations, but very few high-level messages
 
 * absence of lambdas
 
 * tedious checked-exceptions handling
 
 * lack of precondition validation primitives
 
 * complex reflection api
 
 * among others
 
 As all the staccatocommons code, it does it using a mixture of functional and object-oriented programming concepts and styles, without introducing a new programming language, but rather as a set of libraries.
